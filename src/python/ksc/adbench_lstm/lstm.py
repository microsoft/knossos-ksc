# A reference implementation of D-LSTM, so that we can test our
# Knossos implementation.
#
# Please note that this is an LSTM with diagonal weight matrices, not
# a full LSTM.  Its purpose is to calculate the exact same thing that
# ADBench's D-LSTM implementation calculates, not to implement a full
# LSTM.  If and when ADBench changes its implementation to a full
# LSTM, we will too.
#
# This code is an as-close-as-possible port of ADBench's Tensorflow
# implementation to numpy.  The only reason it is changed at all is
# that I want to avoid picking up a Tensorflow dependency.  See
#
#     https://github.com/awf/ADBench/blob/e5f72ab5dcb453b1bb72dd000e5add6b90502ec4/src/python/modules/Tensorflow/TensorflowLSTM.py
