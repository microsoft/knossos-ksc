# Knossos Dialect

This was an attempt of getting a Knossos-like dialect into MLIR. Turns out that
Knossos can be directly represented into the existing standard dialects and we
want to be able to apply the rewrite into more than just Knossos examples, so
we decided to go straight to standard/loop and ignore this dialect for now.

It will remain here for historical reasons, and if in case someone wants to
revive it, can start from an intermediate state, not back to square zero.
