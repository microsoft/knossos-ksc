## About Knossos

Knossos is the home of the Minotaur, a scary monster representing handwritten gradients in C++.  If you want to achieve the power of that monster, you can start by writing simple slow gradient code, then slowly transform it to scary fast gradient code, a but like traversing a maze, a bit like the one on Knossos.
