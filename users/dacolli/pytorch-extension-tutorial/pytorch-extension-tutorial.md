# PyTorch C++ and CUDA Extensions Tutorial

This directory contains the code for a CUDA extension from the PyTorch tutorial:
[Custom C++ and CUDA Extensions](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html)

I have tested this code successfully on a VM running Ubuntu 18.04 with CUDA 10.2.
(Note that the default CUDA toolkit on this VM is 10.0, but that is not compatible
with the PyTorch extension framework.)
